# Sobriety-Test-Game

## Project Summary

This is a sobriety test game. The idea is that hand-eye coordination is hampered by effects of alcohol leading to more errors made by the player.
The player runs their cursor through a maze to reach the end. If the cursor leaves the designated path, an error occurs. Their is a timer which urges the player to act quickly.
